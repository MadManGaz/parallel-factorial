# Parallel Factorial ⚙️

Calculates factorial numbers using rayon for parallel processing.

## Example

Calculating 1000000! with a serial algorithm takes 44 seconds on an Apple M1.

1000000! using this parallel algorithm takes 2.15 seconds.

## Purpose

Simple learning project to figure out how to use rayon for some number
crunching. This is very unlikely to be useful to anyone but it's here
regardless 🙂
